# Laevis: a Legendoom addon

Ever played Legendoom, but wish you didn't have to choose just one of those tasty powers for each of your weapons? If so, this mod may be what you're looking for.

Laevis lets you collect a library of Legendoom powers for each weapon. Only one power can be active at a time, but you can switch between them at will. Discarding powers you don't need upgrades the library, letting you store more powers for that weapon.

## Setup

Add `Laevis-<version>.pk3` to your load order. It must load after Legendoom.

If you are also using Gun Bonsai, you must use GB 0.11.0 or later; 0.10.x and earlier versions are incompatible with Laevis.

Laevis adds two new mandatory commands, which you may want to rebind:
- "Laevis: Power Menu", bound to `P` by default, displays a list of all powers your current weapon has ingested, and lets you select one
- "Laevis: Cycle Power", bound to `V` by default, switches immediately to the next power in your current weapon

Laevis also has its own options page, with many tuning and compatibility options. The defaults should be sensible for vanilla Doom 2 play, but I highly recommend flipping through it and making sure they are to your taste; the settings are self-documenting with in-game tooltips.

## Mod Compatibility

Laevis is an addon for Legendoom and requires Legendoom to function. It should be compatible with most mods that Legendoom itself is compatible with.

## FAQ

### Why "Laevis"?

It is named after *Lepidobatrachus laevis*, aka the Wednesday Frog, which consumes anything smaller than itself and grows larger and more powerful thereby.

### Didn't you have another mod with this name?

"Laevis" was the working title for early prototypes of my first mod, [Gun Bonsai](FIXME).


## Credits

Coding was done by me, Rebecca "ToxicFrog" Kelly; no code from other mods is incorporated, but I did learn a great deal about ZScript by studying existing mods, especially LegenDoom, MetaDoom, Universal Pistol Start, Champions, and Corruption Cards.

I also owe a debt of gratitude to everyone on the Secreta Lounge who helped me learn the ins and outs of Doom modding, answered my incessant questions about ZScript, and playtested this mod.
