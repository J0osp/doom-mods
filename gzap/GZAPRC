# gzArchipelago run control file.
# This overrides the behaviour of the scanner and check-placer based on actor
# types.
#
# Available directives are:
#
#     category <cat> : <list of classes> ;
# Assign the listed classes to the given category. Any category can be specified,
# including ones not otherwise known to the scanner -- they will be passed through
# to the apworld as is. This can be used to add objects to the scan that would
# normally be skilled, or change the category of objects.
#
# "key", "map", and "weapon" have special handling in the generator:
# - keys are used in reachability calculations and are limited to the level on
#   which they are picked up
# - weapons are used for combat balancing and also affect reachability, albeit
#   in different ways
# - maps are converted into checks, but not placed in the item pool; instead the
#   pool is populated (or not) with maps based on other settings
#
# A category of "none" will exclude something from the scan entirely, even if it
# would normally have been included.
#
#     typename <type> : <list of classes> ;
# When scanning anything in the list, report it as being <type> rather than
# whatever its actual type is. The check will be named after that type rather
# than whatever was actually scanned, and the given type, not the original item,
# will be added to the item pool.
