// These are not written to the save file or config file, since they're more
// like commands than settings.
// For most wads, you can just do something like:
// ] ap_scan_levels "MAP01"
// ] netevent ap-scan:start
// and it'll scan the entire wad. If it's broken into episodes, like Doom 1, you
// might instead need something like:
// ] ap_scan_levels "E1M1 E2M1 E3M1 E4M1"
// ] netevent ap-scan:start
// If this is one of those wads where, e.g., there are five levels but they
// continue on into the Doom 2 levels after the last one, you probably want to
// turn off recursion:
// ] ap_scan_recurse false
// ] ap_scan_levels "MAP01 MAP02 MAP03 MAP04 MAP05"
// ] netevent ap-scan:start

// List of levels to scan. If ap_scan_recurse is set, these levels and all
// levels reachable from them will be scanned. Otherwise, only these levels
// exactly will be. Space-separated.
nosave noarchive string ap_scan_levels = "";
// If false, only levels listed in ap_scan_levels will be scanned. If true, any
// level reachable by exits from those levels will be as well, recursively.
// Caveats:
// - level transitions using zscript or intermap teleport specials are not
//   currently detected, only NextMap/NextSecretMap MAPINFO entries
// - levels listed in NextSecretMap are considered reachable even if there is
//   no secret exit in the level itself
