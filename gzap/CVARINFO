// TODO: config settings for gzap.

//// Map options
// Check icons - display always, or only with automap?
// Alternate automap behaviour ideas:
// progressive per level -- need one to display icons, two to display world geometry
// progressive across levels -- each one gives you the map for the open level with
// the most checks remaining; if you have no open levels with checks it saves it
// until you enter the next one
// alternately, let the player hold automaps in her inventory
// am_map_secrets - 1 hilights secrets once discovered, 2 always
// am_showtriggerlines - 1 hilights switches, 2 also hilights doors

//// Powerup options
// Can you take it with you?
  // this has technical difficulties
// Item buffering
  // With this, it stores a list of items that you've received and gives them to
  // you automatically.
  // It can do this based on the item category:
  // - weapons, tools, and upgrades are vended immediately
  // - health is vended if you are <50% health
  // - armour if you are <25% armour
  // - ammo is vended if you're at <50% ammo for the corresponding ammo type,
  //   or if it can't find the corresponding type, <50% for any ammo.

//// Death options
// Reset level on death?
