// TODO: figure out some way to dynamically put all maps into the same cluster.
// This is hard because the contents of a MAPINFO *completely override* any
// early configurations for those maps.
//
// Possibly we're going to have to do something super gross, like in the scanner,
// read the MAPINFO lump and dump it, and then in the randomizer, ingest that,
// edit it with the appropriate cluster definitions, and emit it into the runtime
// pk3.
//
// This also assumes that we can actually unsnapshot levels. There is a function
// for it in C++ -- LevelLocals::UnSnapshotLevel() -- but it doesn't appear to
// be exposed to ZScript. This means that to unsnapshot, we'd need to temporarily
// yank the player out of the cluster, which would reset *all* levels.
//
// For now I think we just don't have level snapshotting, much as I wish we did.
//
// After further testing, I think we need to do the MAPINFO dump anyways even if
// we don't have snapshotting, because otherwise entertext/exittext will fire
// A LOT while you go in and out of the level select menu, and there's no way to
// clear those from zscript, nor any way to "blanket clear" them from MAPINFO.
