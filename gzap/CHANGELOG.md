# 0.1.1

This is a bugfix release.

- Change:
  - AP client is now called "GZDoom Client" rather than "Text Client"
  - A message displays in gzDoom when the connection to AP is established
- Fix:
  - Crash on game startup in certain rando configurations that exclude levels
  - gzdoom launch arguments emitted by client are now copy-pasteable even in
    the GUI
  - Command line flags reported by the client should hopefully work on Windows

# 0.1.0
