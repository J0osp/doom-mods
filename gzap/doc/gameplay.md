TBW. Needs to cover:

- what files to download
- brief note on logic file generation + link to main docs
- generating your game (SW and MW)
- how to play in SW (load order)
- how to play in MW (client setup, etc)

Some of this needs more work in code, e.g. the client is currently a spicy disaster
for anyone who isn't me.
