GunBonsai Addon: Scavenger uses Angelic Aviary Angelic Shards
-------------------------------------------------------------

Modification to drop Angelic Shards instead of GunBonsai's built in actors for
the Scavenger bonuses.  To work, "Use builtin actors for Scavenge drops" in 
GunBonsai's setting needs to be "On".  Please note, the Angelic Shards are
still subject to the Scavenger's scaling values, despite the Life Shard saying
that it's max value is 250.
