# Compatibility Patches

This directory contains patches that improve Gun Bonsai's behaviour with other
mods. You should not install them unless you are using the relevant mods, and
if using them, should load them after both GB and the mod in question.

**Mandatory** patches are ones that prevent things from breaking. **Optional**
patches may add polish but the game will still be playable normally without them.

## Mandatory

- `GunBonsai×HighNoonDrifter`: fixes the HND bow when used with GB.

## Optional

- `GunBonsai×AngelicAviary-AngelicShards`: replaces the builtin actors for Scavenge Blood and Scavenge Steel with AA's actors.
- `GunBonsai×WarTrophies-NoDOTKills`: does not record kills made with GB damage-over-time effects in WT.
